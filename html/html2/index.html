    <h1><b><i>This article is about the country. For other uses, see India (disambiguation).</i></b></h1>
    <p><b>India</b>, officially the <b>Republic of India</b>,[j][20] is a country in South Asia. It is the
        seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country since 2023;[21] and, since its independence in 1947,
        the world's most populous democracy.[22][23][24] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on
        the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[k]
        China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is
        near Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Myanmar, Thailand,
        and Indonesia.</p>

        Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than <mark>55,000 years
            ago</mark>.[26][27][28] Their
        long occupation, predominantly in isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse.[29] Settled
        life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving
        gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[30] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of
        Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[31][32] Its hymns recorded the
        early dawnings of Hinduism in India.[33] India's pre-existing Dravidian languages were supplanted in the
        northern regions.[34] By 400 BCE, caste had emerged within Hinduism,[35] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen,
        proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[36] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit
        Maurya and Gupta Empires.[37] Widespread creativity suffused this era,[38] but the status of women declined,[39]
        and untouchability became an organised belief.[l][40] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian
        language scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[41]

        In the 1st millennium, <u>Islam, Christianity</u>, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's
        southern
        and western coasts.[42] In the early centuries of the 2nd millennium Muslim armies from Central Asia
        intermittently overran India's northern plains.[43] The resulting Delhi Sultanate drew northern India into the
        cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[44] In south India, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting
        composite Hindu culture.[45] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[46] The
        Mughal Empire ushered in two centuries of economic expansion and relative peace,[47] and left a rich
        architectural legacy.[48][49] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company turned India into a
        colonial economy but consolidated its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to
        Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education
        and the public life took root. <sub>[53]</sub> A nationalist movement emerged in India, the first in the
        non-European
        British Empire and an influence on other nationalist movements.[54][55] Noted for nonviolent resistance after
        1920,[56] it became the primary factor in ending British rule. <sup>[57]</sup> In 1947, the British Indian
        Empire was
        partitioned into two independent dominions,[58][59][60][61] a Hindu-majority dominion of India and a
        Muslim-majority dominion of Pakistan. A large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration accompanied
